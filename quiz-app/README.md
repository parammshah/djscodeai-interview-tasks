## Reflection
While building this project, I learned how to manage **dynamic DOM updates**, handle **user interactions**, and maintain **quiz state** (questions, score, progress). The main challenge was ensuring clean logic for feedback and score tracking. I also practiced separating concerns by keeping **questions in a separate file** and using CSS for theme consistency. Next steps could include adding a **timer**, **animations**, and **leaderboard** using `localStorage`.
